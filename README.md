AI Kingdom
==========

AI Kingdom is a tiny fantasy sandbox where you shape the world, one cell at a time.

Inspired by SimCity, but set in a whimsical medieval realm, AI Kingdom plays out on a cozy 5×5 grid that evolves turn by turn using a cellular automata. The twist? Each tile is updated by an AI language model, not hardcoded rules. You’re not just placing buildings, you're writing the story of the land.

Want to cause chaos or create harmony? It’s up to you.

💬 Try writing things like:

- “A spy poisons the well” → A plague spreads across nearby villages.
- “A royal wedding takes place” → The village becomes a castle.
- “Bandits raid the northern farms” → See how the region reacts next turn.

In addition to storytelling, you have structured actions: gather resources, upgrade settlements, and change the map. For example, mine stone from a quarry, then use it to transform a village into a castle.

There are no scores, timers, or enemies. Just you, the map, and your imagination. It’s a sandbox for playful experimentation and emergent storytelling.

🌱 Future plans may include:

- Scenario challenges like “contain a spreading fire” or “build five castles”
- Optional goals for players who want direction

For now, it's a magical little toybox. Write your kingdom into existence.
